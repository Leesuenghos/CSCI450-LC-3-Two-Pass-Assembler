**Description**

Implement the stubbed out `is_keyword()` function in the `opcode.[h|c]`
class/file.  This method is currently a stub function that always returns 
`false`.  It needs to instead return `true` if the token being
translated is one of the given 29 valid LC-3 keywords for a valid
`opcode`.


**Suggested Solution**



**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to use the defined `keywords[]` array and the
  `NUM_KEYWORD` constant given directly above this function in your
  implementation.
